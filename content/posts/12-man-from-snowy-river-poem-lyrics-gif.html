    <h3>The snowy river is indeed a real river in australia, with its headwaters in the highest section of the great dividing range near the easternmost part of the border between new south wales and victoria.</h3>
    <p>Pioneering days, bravery and foolishness, friends and foes are put into poems from an australia from long ago but still alive. Describes the fame the man from snowy river attained by this daring feat of horsemanship. The character is namedropped in the original poem the man from snowy river, but is given a significant role in the movie. He hails from snowy river, up by kosciusko&#039;s side, where the hills are twice as steep and twice as rough, where a horse&#039;s hoofs strike firelight from the flint stones every stride, the man that holds his own is good enough.</p>
