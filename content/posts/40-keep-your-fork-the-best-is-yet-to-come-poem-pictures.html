                I am glad that you are enjoying your holiday however, it has gained traction since the song the best is yet to come was recorder by tony bennet in 1958. Focus on finding moments in the day that are good. By rudyard kipling, read by james barbour.

    <h3>She asked her pastor to come to her home to discuss her final wishes.</h3>
    <p>If you can dream—and not make dreams your master if you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, or walk with kings—nor lose the common touch; But it always will be better, if we will just keep in mind ­ the best is yet to come ­ just give it some time! There was a woman who had been diagnosed with a terminal illness and had been given 3 months to live. So the next time you reach down for your fork, let it remind you, ever so gently, that the best is yet to come.</p>
