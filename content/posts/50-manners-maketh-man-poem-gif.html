                If manners maketh man, as someone said then he&#039;s the hero of the day it takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile be yourself, no matter what they say. In other words having manners and being considerate and treating people with respect is what defines a man and makes him a man that ability to show humility and kindness is what defines that person and probably we think and we should know. Manners maketh man. and they are a lost virtue which we have to, which we should revive and carry out of their graves.

To hear that so many of our students intervened to stop this crime restores my faith in the youth of the world. (you think that you got us fooled, we know you&#039;re up to something, i can tell by the way your talking, you don&#039;t know whats coming).</p>
