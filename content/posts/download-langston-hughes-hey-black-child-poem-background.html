    <h3>Countee cullen&#039;s &#039;hey, black child&#039; is a moving and memorable poem that is directed to and dedicated to all the black children who have been taught by the world that their lives can&#039;t amount to anything.</h3>
    <p>Make it something dramatic and well known or maybe funny and well known, but i&#039;m goin more hi harrisa5! Hey black child be what you want to be learn what you must learn do what you must do and tomorrow your nation will be what you want it to be. This poem is about a little black child who wants to play with the other kids who are white but doesn&#039;t. Hughes wrote poetry, plays, and works of fiction, and in 1938 when he was 31, traveled to the soviet union to help make a movie about the black struggle against segregation in the u.s.</p>
