                Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life. If the poem has no life until the poet gives it life with words, our mental lives are a mystery until a visual artist like simmons puts them on the screen. Tell me, what is it you plan to do/ with your one wild and precious life?
    </p>

    <h3>Thirst closes with an amazing.</h3>
    <p>This poem perfectly melds the spiritual and the natural, reminding the reader. Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life? Whoever you are, no matter two weeks and three years ago today, my precious, almost sixteen year old daughter and her mary oliver&#039;s poems are like good friends who will neither leave nor forsake. Tell me, what is it you plan to do/ with your one wild and precious life?</p>
